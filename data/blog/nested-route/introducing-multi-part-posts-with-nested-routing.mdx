For almost a year now, I have been writing my most story-worthy moments of the day. It was an activity I learned about from a book called StoryWorthy by Matthew Dicks, and I thought it would be awesome to look back at a collection of memories in the future. Let me share a few with you:

On June 4th 2021, I had the opportunity to attend as a panelist at a STEM conference and later that night, I watched a movie called Arrival üé• By the excitement in the way I talked about Arrival in my journal, it seems like I really enjoyed the movie! On March 10, 2021, I apparently ate lots of apples and oranges ahaha üçé üçä I was eating lots of apples and oranges after a debate workshop I attended a few days prior about the art of argumentation. They used the motion, this house believes that apples are better than oranges as an example to explain how to best structure your arguments in a debate üé§ 

I love how I am able to associate certain memories to specific days with this journaling, and have the ability to recall memories that I had forgotten beforehand. Definitely an activity I'll be continuing :$)$
